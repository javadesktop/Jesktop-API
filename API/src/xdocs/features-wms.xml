    <s1 title="Overview">
      <p>
        Jesktop supports different window manager concepts.  Windows, Mac and others can be created for a lookalike desktop.
      </p>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="Detailed">
      <p>
        Window managers are implemented using Avalon's component architecture.  This means that there are plugable in a configuration file. At some point in the future Avalon will provide a hot plugable facility, at which point the user will be able to chose a new Window Manager inside Jesktop and switch to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage what we mean by window manager is the style and placement of the controls for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mechanism of visible containment of running apps
        </li>
        <li>
          Choice of available applications to launch
        </li>
        <li>
          Display in summary form of applications that are running
        </li>
      </ul>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="Windoze window manager">
      <p>
        The Window Manager developed in Jesktop is a Microsoft Windows look-alike. This means that we have a Frame with internal frames, a start button and menu and a task bar.  At the moment these are fixed at the bottom, and require some cosmetic clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented two variations on the same idea:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WindozeWindowManager1</strong> This is the Windows style window manager using a JInternalFrame containment mechanism</li>
        <li><strong>WindozeWindowManager2</strong> This is the Windows style window manager using a JFrame containment mechanism.  This means that each launched app appears on the host operating system's list of frames (or window in Window's speak).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To switch between them, edit assembly.xml and change the reference from WindozeWindowManager1 to WindozeWindowManager2 (or v.v.).  This can be done before vuilding, by editing the assembly.xml file in &lt;jesktop root&gt;/conf, or after first deployment of Jesktop in Avalon/dist/apps/jesktop/config/  <strong>This is really easy to do</strong>
      </p>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="The future">
      <p>
        We plan to implement remote and switchable window managers.
